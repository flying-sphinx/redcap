h1. Redcap

Redcap was written because I need to track SSH remote forwards by their process id, and all I have is the port they're forwarding to. You can't pair the two together unless you have root access, though - and that's where Redcap comes in. You run Redcap as root, and then you can ask it to do the pairing for you.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>gem install redcap</code></pre>

h2. Usage

As a server, you'll also want EventMachine installed:

<pre><code>gem install eventmachine</code></pre>

And then, the service must be run as root (so it can get all the requierd port and process information):

<pre><code>$ sudo redcap</code></pre>

And in code, as a client:

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'redcap'
Redcap.pid_for_port(10342) #=> 26151</code></pre>

h2. Author

"Pat Allan":http://freelancing-gods.com wrote this code in May 2011, but all the hard work for daemonising the process, logging, and a pid file was done in a gist by "James Healy":http://yob.id.au.
